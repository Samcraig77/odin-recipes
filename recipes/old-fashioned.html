    <h1>Old fashioned</h1>
    <img src="../photos/oldfashioned.jpg">
    <p>One of my personal favorites of all time, the smokey cocktail
        that leaps off the menu at me every time. There are numerous ways to get the same result
        as this recipe but this is my favorite way!
    </p>
    <h2>What you'll need</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of simple syrup (add a lightly flavored one for a more unique taste)</li>
        <li>2 dashes of Old Fashioned bitters (sub for any of your favorite bitters)</li>
        <li>2 ounces of bourbon</li>
        <li>Orange peel for garnish (this also adds a great complexity to the pallet)</li>
        <li>ICE!!! Make sure you add ice, it helps the bourbon have more body!</li>
    </ul>

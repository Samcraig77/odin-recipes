    <p>Not a whole lot to say about this classic. Most who know it, love it and if you can get that crust just right, you will never look at other meat the same</p>
    <h2>What you need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt (from a grinder if possible</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 steak (I recommend a New York strip)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps (I mean I guess?)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine red wine, salt and rosemary. Let stand at room temp for 2 to 3 hours</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan or griddle over high heat. Place the steak in the heated pan and cook for about 8 minutes per side. For medium rare you want to make sure the internal temperature of the steak reaches 145F.
            Pour in the wine mixture and allow it to boil for a minute. Serve with sauce on a deep plate!
